What is graph learningConsidering an undirected and weighted graph G=($\\mathcal{V}$,$\\mathcal{E}$) with no self-loops, where $\\mathcal{V}={1,\\dots,N}$ represent the node and $\\mathcal{E}={(i, j, w_{i j}), i, j \\in \\mathcal{V}}$ represent the edge with weights $w_{i j}$.The paper focus on learning the Laplacian matrix $L$(Symmetric positive semi-define matrix)$=D - W$, where $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix and $W$ the weight matrix. $Lâ€™s$ eigenvalue decomposition is $L=X \\Lambda X^{\\top}$ with $\\Lambda=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_N\\right)$ a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues and $X=\\left(x_1, \\ldots, x_N\\right)$ a matrix with the eigenvectors as columns.A graph signal is defined as a function $y: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^N$ that assigns a scalar value to each vertex. The two concepts of smoothness and spectral representation in graph learning problems are explained as follows: SmoothnessA graph signal $y$ is s-smooth with respect to the graph:\\begin{equation} y^{\\top} L y=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j} w_{i j}\\left(y_i-y_j\\right)^2 \\leq s\\tag{1} \\label{smooth} \\end{equation} where $s\\ge 0$ is smoothness level. Spectral sparsityA graph signal $y$ admits a $k$-sparse spectral representation with respect to the graph: $$|h|_0 \\leq k$$ where $h=X^Ty$ for Graph Fourier Transform.","link":"/blog/2022/11/01/Reading/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Optimization","slug":"Optimization","link":"/blog/tags/Optimization/"},{"name":"Graph learning","slug":"Graph-learning","link":"/blog/tags/Graph-learning/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Paper Reading","slug":"Paper-Reading","link":"/blog/categories/Paper-Reading/"}],"pages":[{"title":"About Me","text":"Hi, thanks for visiting my blog, to know more information about me, you can browse my Personal Page","link":"/blog/about/index.html"}]}
